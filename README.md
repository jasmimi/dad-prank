# Dad Prank
I think this would be funny. Hopefully my dad enjoys it. This project uses openCV to create live video feed using webcam. Only 'Hikaia Amohia' (HA) has a recognised face_encoding. When detected faces aren't recognised as HA, there's a fairy whimsical overlay and pleasant music plays. When HA is recognised, police lights are overlayed and emergency sirens sound. lol

### 
The [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/tree/master) project by [Adam Geitgey](https://github.com/ageitgey) has been invaluable to the development of dad-prank. I've also used this project in my university degree. I couldn't recommend it enough!
